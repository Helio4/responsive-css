# About this project
This is a website I made to practice some basic html and css, while making sure the site is fully responsive to all kind of screen resolutions.
<br><br>
The scope of the project is to make just the main page, but make it look as profesional and responsive as possible. For that I made use of SCSS, basic HTML and JavaScript.
